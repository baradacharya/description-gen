Dependencies
---
To run the models and evaluation code you will need a current version of
[Python](https://www.python.org) (version 2.7 or greater should work). In
addition, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)


Downloading the MAE Dataset
---
Training and validation are performed using a subset of the
[MAE Dataset](#to-be-added). We have included scripts to download the dataset,
demonstrated below:

```shell
# Location to save the data to.
DATA_DIR=/tmp/data/description-gen

# Run the download script.
source download.sh
```
